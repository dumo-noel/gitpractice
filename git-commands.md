There’s a git command for that

Git commands aren’t always intuitive. If they were, we would have these 10 commands at our disposal. They would be super useful for accomplishing common tasks like creating or renaming a git branch, removing files, and undoing changes.

For each git command in our wishlist, we’ll show you the commands that actually exist and you can use to accomplish the same tasks. If you’re still learning Git, this list reads like a tutorial and is worth keeping as a cheatsheet.

Git commands on the wish-list:

    # 9 – git create branch
    # 8 – git force pull
    # 7 – git remove untracked files
    # 6 – git unstage
    # 5 – git undo merge
    # 4 – git remove file
    # 3 – git uncommit
    # 2 – git diff between branches
    # 1 – git delete tag
    # 0 – git rename branch
